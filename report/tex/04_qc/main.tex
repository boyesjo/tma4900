\chapter{Quantum computing}
\label{chap:qc}
Quantum computing is a new paradigm of computation that uses quantum mechanical phenomena to perform computations, thereby having the potential to solve certain problems exponentially faster than can classical computing.
The field of quantum computing is split into two main branches: the development of quantum hardware and the study of algorithms that use such hardware.
Only the latter is relevant to this thesis, and even so, only a brief explanation is offered here.
For more details, see~\autocite{nielsen2012} for a rigorous, complete description or~\autocite{qiskit_textbook} for an introduction focused on programming.
% This chapter is primarily based on the Qiskit textbook~\autocite{qiskit_textbook},~\autocitetitle{schuld2021a} by \textcite{schuld2021a} and~\autocitetitle{nielsen2012} by \textcite{nielsen2012}.
% The discussion of variational quantum algorithms in \cref{sec:vqa} is based on the review by \textcite{cerezo2021}.
Any reader should have a basic understanding of linear algebra, classical computing and computational complexity.
Knowledge of quantum mechanics is not assumed, albeit certainly helpful.
