All algorithms were implemented in Python 3~\autocite{python} with quantum computing support provided by IBM's Qiskit library~\autocite{qiskit} for the QUCB algorithm and PennyLane for the quantum neural network policy agent.
The experiments were run on an external computation server with an Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 CPU and 768 GB of RAM, permitting 28 concurrent simulations.
